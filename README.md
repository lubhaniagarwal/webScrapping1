# webScrapping1
This Project is about scrapping useful information from the website without harming the security and private information.
I used python and requests and beautiful Soup to scrap the information from the website.
The website used here is one of my projects that I built:-
https://nameless-meadow-64755.herokuapp.com/


The information extract are :

--> Experience of farmers:
1. Title of experience 
2. Image posted 
3. Experience shared by farmers.

The result is stored in CSV format that can be further used to apply on various machine learning algorithms and derive useful informations.

Web scrapping is done for learning purpose and have no intention of causing any harm.
